# _Drops of Jupiter in Her Hair_

#### _An application to explore living on another planet_

#### By _Allison Sadin_

## Age Calculator

_This application will allow a user to input their current age and well as their life expectancy based on their background and demographics. Thes application will calculate the following and return this information to the user. It will calculate the user's age in the given planet's years. It will calculate how many years a person has left to live based on their life expectancy and return the number in the specified planet's years. If a person has surpassed their life expectancy, then the program will return how many years past their life expectancy they have lived in the specified planet's years._

### Specs
1. Create class constructor for user that includes properties of userAge, userLifeExpectancy and planetYearsInEarthYears.
* Input: N/A
* Output:  function Person(userEarthAge, userLifeExpectancy, planetYearsInEarthYears) { this.age = userAge, this.iserLifeExpectancy = userLifeExpectancy, this.planetYearsInEarthYears = planetYearsInEarthYears}

2. Create a function prototype that calculates the user's age on planet mercury.
* Input: userEarthAge: 30 years
* Output: mercuryAge: 125 years

3. create prototype to calculate userLifeExpectancy on mercury.
* Input: userLifeExpectancy: 100 years
* Output: mercuryLifeExpectancy: 416 years

4. create prototype to calculate how many years you have left on mercury given your life expectancy.
* Input: userLifeExpectancy: 100, userAge: 30
* Output: yearsLeft: 70 / .24 = 291 years left

5. create prototype to calculate if userEarthAge is greater than userLifeExpectancy return the difference in mercury years.
* Input: UserEarthAge: 101, userLifeExpectancy: 100
* Output: (UserEarthAge - userLifeExpectancy) / .24 = 4.16 years mercuryYears over life expectancy


6. create prototype to calculate userAge on venus.
* Input: userEarthAge: 30 years
* Output: venusAge: 48 years


7. create prototype to calculate userLifeExpectancy on venus.
* Input: userLifeExpectancy: 100 years
* Output: venusLifeExpectancy: 161 years

8. create prototype to calculate how many years you have left on venus given your life expectancy.
* Input: userLifeExpectancy: 100, userAge: 30
* Output: yearsLeft: 70 / .62 = 113 years left

9. create prototype to calculate if userEarthAge is greater than userLifeExpectancy return the difference in venus years.
* Input: UserEarthAge: 101, userLifeExpectancy: 100
* Output: (UserEarthAge - userLifeExpectancy) / .62 = 1.61 years venusYears over life expectancy

10. create prototype to calculate userAge on mars.
* Input: userEarthAge: 30 years
* Output: marsAge: 16 years

11. create prototype to calculate userLifeExpectancy on mars.
* Input: userLifeExpectancy: 100 years
* Output: marsLifeExpectancy: 53 years

12. create prototype to calculate how many years you have left on mars given your life expectancy.
* Input: userLifeExpectancy: 100, userAge: 30
* Output: yearsLeft: 70 / 1.88 = 37.23 years left

13. create prototype to calculate if userEarthAge is greater than userLifeExpectancy return the difference in mars years.
* Input: UserEarthAge: 101, userLifeExpectancy: 100
* Output: (UserEarthAge - userLifeExpectancy) / 1.88 = .53 years marsYears over life expectancy

14. create prototype to calculate userAge on jupiter.
* Input: userEarthAge: 30 years
* Output: marsAge: 2.5 years

15. create prototype to calculate userLifeExpectancy on jupiter.
* Input: userLifeExpectancy: 100 years
* Output: jupiterLifeExpectancy: 8 years

16. create prototype to calculate how many years you have left on jupiter given your life expectancy.
* Input: userLifeExpectancy: 100, userAge: 30
* Output: yearsLeft: 70 / .11.86 = 5.9 years left

17. create prototype to calculate if userEarthAge is greater than userLifeExpectancy return the difference in jupiter years.
* Input: UserEarthAge: 105, userLifeExpectancy: 90
* Output: (UserEarthAge - userLifeExpectancy) / 11.86 = 0.084 years jupiterYears over life expectancy
