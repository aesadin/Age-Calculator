## Age Calculator

_This application will allow a user to input their current age and well as their life expectancy based on their background and demographics. Thes application will calculate the following and return this information to the user. It will calculate the user's age in the given planet's years. It will calculate how many years a person has left to live based on their life expectancy and return the number in the specified planet's years. If a person has surpassed their life expectancy, then the program will return how many years past their life expectancy they have lived in the specified planet's years._

### Specs
1. Create class constructor for user that includes properties of userAge, userLifeExpectancy and planetYearsInEarthYears.
* Input: N/A
* Output:  function Person(userEarthAge, userLifeExpectancy, planetYearsInEarthYears) { this.age = userAge, this.iserLifeExpectancy = userLifeExpectancy, this.planetYearsInEarthYears = planetYearsInEarthYears}

2. Create a function prototype that calculates the user's age on the selected planet.
* Input: userEarthAge: 30 years
* Output: mercuryAge: 125 years

3. create prototype to calculate userLifeExpectancy on the selected planet.
* Input: userLifeExpectancy: 100 years
* Output: mercuryLifeExpectancy: 416 years

4. create prototype to calculate how many years you have left on the selected planet given your life expectancy.
* Input: userLifeExpectancy: 100, userAge: 30
* Output: yearsLeft: 70 / .24 = 291 years left

5. create prototype to calculate if userEarthAge is greater than userLifeExpectancy return the difference in the selected planet's years.
* Input: UserEarthAge: 101, userLifeExpectancy: 100
* Output: (UserEarthAge - userLifeExpectancy) / .24 = 4.16 years mercuryYears over life expectancy
